        <h2>Using Basic Logic</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Lets get started by saying GIF is pronounced with a hard-G like in "gift". It is not said with a soft-G that mimics "j".<br><br>
            Go through the following to have your mind expanded to the inarguable way to say this word.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="simpleQuestions.html">Simple Questions to make you think</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Don't just take my word for it!</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Don't believe me by now? <br>
            Here's support from outside sources in favor of the "hard-G".
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="hardGSupport.html">Support for the "Hard-G"</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other side of the coin</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Unfortunately I have to show the side in favor of the soft-G.<br><br>
            The creator of Gif recieved a lifetime achievement award at the 2013 Webby Awards. His five-word acceptance speech was "It's pronounced "Jif" not "Gif"" ... this is the <b>only</b> argument for a soft-G.<br><br>
            However, Linguists and I still see this as incorrect for many reasons stated above <b>and so should you.</b>
        </p>
        

        <h2>At the end of the day, its your call</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Before making your final choice I recommed watching this well made short video on the topic:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1AL2EMvVy0">It’s pronounced GIF. - Youtube(Tom Scott)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="finalStatement">
            All I'm arguing is what does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wilhite">Steve Wilhite</a>, a computer scientist and the creator of GIF, know about linguistics?
        </p>
        <p class="smallText">**and if you use a soft-G you're wrong**<br><br></p>
